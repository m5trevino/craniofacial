# ⚡ SYMMETRY ARCHITECT // V6: BLACK BOX EDITION

> **OPERATIONAL STATUS:** ACTIVE
> **CLASSIFICATION:** FORENSIC ANALYSIS TOOL
> **VERSION:** 6.0 (React/Vite)

## 💀 THE MISSION
**Symmetry Architect** is not a vanity filter. It is a **Structural Interrogation Unit**.

Standard image comparison tools rely on static transparency, which allows the human brain to "fill in the gaps" and see matches where none exist. This tool eliminates cognitive bias by using **Difference Blending Mathematics** and **Biometric Locking** to reveal the raw structural delta between two datasets.

Whether analyzing historical doppelgängers, checking physiognomic alignment, or performing forensic image verification, this system provides the raw numbers.

## ⚙️ CORE CAPABILITIES

### 1. 🏳️ HYBRID CONTROL SYSTEM
-   **Direct Manipulation:** Click and drag on the canvas for 1:1 tactical positioning.
-   **Tactical Rig:** On-screen D-Pad and Sliders for pixel-perfect micro-adjustments (Zoom, Tilt, Shift).
-   **Golden Grid:** Toggleable biometric wireframe for centering datasets before analysis.

### 2. 🕵️ FORENSIC MODE (THE TRUTH)
-   **Difference Blending algorithm** (`|A - B| = Delta`).
-   **The Void:** Pure black pixels indicate a 100% mathematical match.
-   **The Neon:** Glowing pixels indicate structural deviation.
-   **Auto-Lock:** Instantly disables opacity controls to force a raw data comparison.

### 3. 🧠 AUTOMATED SCORING ENGINE
-   **Structural Integrity Score:** The system scans the pixel buffer of the "Difference Layer."
-   It calculates the luminance variance across the matched crop.
-   Returns a percentage **(0-100%)** representing the geometric probability of a match.

### 4. 📂 THE EVIDENCE LOCKER
-   **One-Click Reporting:** Compiles a high-resolution **4-Panel Intelligence Brief**.
-   **Data Logging:** Burns the exact Zoom, Tilt, and Shift coordinates into the image.
-   **Forensic Legend:** Includes a built-in guide on how to read the analysis, embedded directly in the footer of the evidence file.

## 🔧 OPERATIONAL GUIDE

### PHASE 1: INGESTION
1.  **Load Base (Left):** Upload your reference image (The Anchor).
2.  **Load Overlay (Right):** Upload your comparison asset (The Variable).

### PHASE 2: ALIGNMENT
1.  **Toggle Grid:** Turn on the Cyan Wireframe.
2.  **Align Base:** Drag the base image until the eyes lock with the grid.
3.  **Align Overlay:** Drag the overlay image to match the grid.
4.  **Fine Tune:** Use the **D-Pad** and **Tilt Slider** to perfect the pupil alignment.

### PHASE 3: INTERROGATION
1.  **Engage Forensic Mode:** Click the Fingerprint icon.
2.  **Read the Data:**
    -   **Black/Grey:** Structural Match.
    -   **Bright Color:** Structural Mismatch.
3.  **Check Score:** The system will calculate the integrity percentage in the background.

### PHASE 4: EXTRACTION
1.  **Compile Report:** Click the blue **Compile** button.
2.  **Save Artifact:** Right-click (or long-press) the generated report to save it to your local drive.
